    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The OpenEnergyMonitor project was founded out of a desire for open-source tools to help us relate to our use of energy, our energy systems and the challenge of sustainable energy.
    </p>
    <p>Over the next few decades we will see a revolution in our energy systems as we switch our energy systems away from fossil fuels to a zero carbon energy supply.
    </p>
    <p>By using energy monitoring, modelling and assessment tools we can take an informed approach to working out what are the best measures to apply. We can then check to ensure solutions meet their expected performance and continue to work well over time.

    <p>To learn more about our research into zero carbon energy systems see the sustainable energy section of <a href="https://learn.openenergymonitor.org" style="color:#44b3e2;">Learn</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All of our work is open source (hardware & software). We believe open source is a better way of doing things where we can learn from and build upon each others work, creating better solutions to the challenges we face.
